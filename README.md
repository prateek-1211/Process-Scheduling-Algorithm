# Process-Scheduling-Algorithm

# Description:

Implemented a Process Scheduling Algorithm project in C++ as part of an Operating System course project.
Chose the First Come First Serve Scheduling algorithm for its simplicity and fairness.
Designed and implemented data structures to represent processes and the scheduler.
Developed a simulation environment to create, schedule, and execute processes.
Tested the implementation with various scenarios to ensure correctness and efficiency.

First in, first out (FIFO), also known as first come, first served (FCFS), is the simplest scheduling algorithm. 
FIFO simply queues processes in the order that they arrive in the ready queue. 
In this, the process that comes first will be executed first and next process starts only after the previous gets fully executed. 
Here we are considering that arrival time for all processes is 0.

# Skills Demonstrated:

Proficiency in C++ programming language.
Understanding of process scheduling algorithms and operating system concepts.
Data structure design and implementation.
Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
Testing and debugging.
